# Pig Game
**Author:** [Victor Hugo Santos Aguiar](https://github.com/vhugoaguiar)

## Overview
This JavaScript project represents a web-based implementation of the classic dice game "Pig." It showcases my skills in web development, JavaScript, and DOM manipulation. The project is inspired by the "Pig Game" section of Udemy's course, "The Complete JavaScript Course 2024: From Zero to Expert!" by Jonas Schmedtmann, but with a personalized touch in code structure and logic.

## Project Description
### Objective
The objective of the "Pig Game" is to accumulate a target score by rolling a six-sided die. Players take turns rolling the die and choosing whether to hold their current score or continue rolling. The first player to reach or exceed the target score wins.

### Gameplay
- Players roll a six-sided die and accumulate points equal to the rolled number.
- If a player rolls a 1, their current turn ends, and they lose all points for that turn.
- Players can choose to "Hold" their current score, adding it to their total score and ending their turn.
- The first player to reach or exceed the target score wins the game.

### Dynamic UI
The user interface is dynamically updated using DOM manipulation to reflect the current game state, scores, and active player.

## Notable Features
- **Enhanced Game Logic:** Personalized game logic for an improved and customized gaming experience.
- **Code Refactoring:** The code has been refactored to enhance readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.
- **Interactive UI:** Users can easily interact with the game through intuitive buttons and visual feedback.
